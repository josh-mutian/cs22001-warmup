1. 
    a) Using a map object to store the collection of People with the Community 
       class gives us a primary index, in our case the username, with which we 
       could search a particular Person in constant time.

2. 
    a) 
    b) On one side, we would need to add a private boolean property in the Person
       class to flag if this Person has turned on the privacy option to only 
       received messages from people in the same community with him/her. This
       private property will have corresponding public setter and getter.

       On the other side, we would need to add a private Community list property 
       in the Person class that refers to the communities a Person is in. This 
       list could be empty since a Person could be in no community. Then, we
       add a private method to the Person class, in_same_community_with(Person &p),
       which searches through the Community list and check if p is in any of
       the communities. Then, we would modify the prototype of
       Person::get_msg(string msg) into Person::get_msg(string msg, Person &sender)
       to pass in sender information. We could then add a filter in the get_msg
       method stipulating that nothing will be done, i.e. inbox.push(msg) will
       not be called if the privacy flag is on AND in_same_community_with(sender)
       returns false.
